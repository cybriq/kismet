1. Implement proof of work chain for validator tokens, integrate as a module into a Cosmos SDK chain, using bitcoin UXTO token ledger model. Proof of work derived from the [ParallelCoin](https://github.com/cybriq/p9) work.
2. Create a multi platform wallet and mining control interface based on the prior work done for ParallelCoin.
3. Launch mainnet.
