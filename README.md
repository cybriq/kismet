Protocol for distributed systems governance

> Live by the dice, but never go all in - David Vennik

## About

In distributed systems, there is a not well understood distinction between leader selection and consensus. 

Kismet separates leadership selection from consensus by creating a separate chain for producing a queue of validators, from a classical consensus based on Tendermint Core that gives fast, regular blocks while enabling a virtually unlimited field of competitors for leadership of the network.
